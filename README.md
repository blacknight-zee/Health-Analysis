# Health-Analysis
Prediction of Possibility of Strokes on the Basis on Human Lifestyle

A machine learning project to predict the likelihood of a stroke using demographic and medical attributes from a healthcare dataset. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training with hyperparameter tuning.

Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)
- **Features:** Age, gender, BMI, glucose level, hypertension, heart disease, etc.
- **Target:** Stroke (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **ML Models:** Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Tools:** Scikit-learn, GridSearchCV, MinMaxScaler, Confusion Matrix

## üöÄ Project Highlights

- Cleaned and preprocessed the data (null values, label encoding, scaling)
- Performed visual EDA to understand stroke risk factors
- Implemented **Logistic Regression** and **KNN** with hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Tracked and compared model execution times



[This project runs in Google Colab]
